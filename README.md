Heartwood::Icons
==========

Heartwood's icons gem provides a simple DSL for uploading assets directly to Amazon S3.

Installation
----------

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'heartwood-icons'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install heartwood-icons

Usage
----------

Hearwood's main feature is its rails generator, which builds an SVG icon sprite from a series of icons in your project.

It expects your icons to conform to a specific structure:

- Icons should be placed in `app/assets/images/icons`. No other directories are searched for icons.
- Icon files should use `.svg` extension. The generator only looks for SVG files in the icons directory.
- The content of the icon must exist within top-level groups (`<g>` elements).
- The artwork should be constrained to a `256px` by `256px` space. (You can build in padding using the `transform` attribute).

_See the `spec/support/example_icon.svg` for an example of a raw icon._

When you're ready to build your sprite, you can do so from the command line:

    $ bundle exec rails generate heartwood:icons:sprite

This creates the sprite file at `app/assets/images/icons.svg`.

Then, to render an icon in your app, use the `heartwood_icon` helper. This will render the SVG inline, which provides the benefit of not making an additional requestion to the server.

```erb
<%= heartwood_icon 'icon_name' %>
```

Replace `icon_name` with the filename of the icon you wish to render (without the `.svg` extension). you may also pass a hash of options, including:

- `class`: Classes to add to the outer `<svg>` element.
- `size`: Adds `hw-icon-#{size}` class to the outer `<svg>` element.

For example, to add your own class to a user icon, it may look something like this:

```erb
<%= heartwood_icon 'user', class: 'my-user-icon' %>
```

Development
----------

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
